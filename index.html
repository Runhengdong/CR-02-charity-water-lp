        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            We partner with local communities to build small, sustainable water projects.
            Every project focuses on simple engineering, hygiene education, and local ownership.
            Your support helps a village gain reliable access to clean water — so children can go to school and families can stay healthy.
